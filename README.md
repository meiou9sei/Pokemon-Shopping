# Pokemon Shopping site

Live demo: http://meiou9sei.github.io/Pokemon-Shopping

## Tech

- HTML & CSS (CSS Animations)
- SASS
- Javascript
- React
- React Router v6

## About

Initially built as part of the [TOP Curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-shopping-cart) as a simple React Router practice app, later repurposed to improve my CSS Animations capabilities with a focus on beautiful animations, responsive design, and improved user experience.

## Highlights

[This section will be filled in after the app is complete]

## Notes

currently limited to first 151 pokemon while I create my own JSON for pokemon (requesting data on 1008 pokemon to pokeapi takes wayyy too long for what I need)
